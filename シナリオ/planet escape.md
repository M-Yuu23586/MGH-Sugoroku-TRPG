# Survival of Destiny! Escape from the Extreme 3√ó3 Map Planet

The players crash-land on a remote and radiation-filled, unexplored planet at the edge of the galaxy. They must repair their damaged spaceship, gather limited resources, and face dangerous enemies in order to escape from this hostile world. This scenario is designed as a tutorial for beginners to TRPG, offering simple rules while allowing players to learn the basics of adventure, with a grand adventure awaiting them.

## Background of the Scenario

This scenario is focused on escaping from a randomly generated planet. The planet features a unique ecosystem, full of strange creatures and unknown plants that stand in the players' way. Gathering resources requires understanding the environment, as some resources depend on specific creature behaviors. Players have crash-landed with only minimal gear and must survive harsh conditions. Severe weather and enemy attacks will challenge the players as they strive to gather resources and repair their spaceship. This scenario emphasizes cooperation, strategic thinking, and survival skills, as players aim to escape from this unknown land.

## Player Roles

Players choose from the following roles, each with unique traits and skills that they can use to help them escape the planet. For example, the Engineer can ‚Äúrepair the spaceship with fewer resources than usual,‚Äù while the Warrior can ‚Äúdefend teammates by drawing enemy attacks during combat.‚Äù

1. **Stalios Tribe üåå (Explorer)**
   - A free-spirited group of travelers who specialize in exploring unknown galaxies and enjoying adventure.

2. **Altera Tribe ‚öîÔ∏è (Warrior)**
   - Masters of stellar energy, the Altera Tribe acts as the protectors of the galaxy, possessing high attack and defense capabilities.

3. **Celestia Tribe üí∞ (Resource Manager)**
   - They dominate intergalactic trade, specializing in negotiation skills and efficiently gathering resources.

4. **Astronix Tribe üî¨ (Engineer)**
   - Scientists well-versed in astrophysics, who explore new frontiers. They use their technical skills and knowledge to apply unique abilities.

5. **Anomalis Tribe üåÄ (Outcast)**
   - A group of mavericks who challenge the conventions of the universe, acting outside of established rules.

Each player takes on one of these roles, working together to escape the planet.

## Planet Generation Phase

At the beginning of the game, the planet is generated randomly with the following elements. First, a die is rolled to determine the type of environment. Next, resources are randomly assigned, allocating what resources are present in each grid cell. Enemy spawning locations are also determined by dice rolls, ensuring they do not affect the players' starting position. This process creates a unique planetary environment every time, offering fresh adventures.

1. **Types of Environment**
   - Radioactive areas, frozen ice fields, scorching deserts, and more exist, each affecting players differently.

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - Resources like iron, carbon, zinc, and heridium are randomly placed, and players gather these to repair the spaceship.

3. **Enemy Spawn**
   - Enemies appear based on player actions, with different types and strengths varying by environment.

4. **Random Events**
   - Random events will occur during the adventure, providing a unique experience each time.

## Game Flow

Each player's spawn location is determined randomly, and they begin exploring on a planet divided into a 3√ó3 grid. Players act in turn, gathering resources, battling enemies, and progressing with spaceship repairs. Resource management and combat outcomes are determined by dice rolls, emphasizing teamwork. The victory condition is repairing the spaceship and escaping the planet; there are no specific defeat conditions.

## Character Creation Phase

Before starting, players generate their characters, determining the following elements:

1. **Stats**
   - Basic stats like health, stamina, attack, and defense are assigned.

2. **Starting Equipment**
   - Players start with minimal equipment, like a mining beam.

3. **Skills**
   - Players choose one skill from classes such as Engineer, Warrior, or Explorer.

4. **Backstory and Role**
   - Players create a backstory for their character, enhancing their role within the game. For example, an Engineer character with a backstory of ‚Äúprevious experience repairing spaceships‚Äù might gain a bonus during repairs, directly influencing gameplay.

## Tools Used During Progression

The following tools are used to ensure smooth gameplay:

1. **Resource Management**
   - Resources collected by players are tracked in a spreadsheet format.

2. **Random Placement of Enemies and Resources**
   - A dice app is used to determine the placement of enemies and resources.

3. **Player Communication**
   - Turn-based communication allows players to strategize their actions.

4. **Dice App**
   - Dice rolls determine the success of actions and enemy behavior.

5. **Spreadsheet App**
   - Used to manage resources and record each player's stats.

## Details on Game Progression

1. **Turn-Based System**
   - Players act in turn, passing control to the next player.

2. **Action Choices**
   - Players choose actions such as exploration, combat, repairs, or resource gathering.

3. **Rolling Dice**
   - Dice rolls decide the outcome of actions and trigger events.

4. **Event Occurrence**
   - Random events may occur based on dice results, adding new dynamics to the game.

5. **Victory and Defeat Conditions**
   - Victory is achieved by repairing the spaceship. There are no set defeat conditions.

## Crafting Effective Prompts for AI

To craft effective prompts for an AI model like GPT-4, keep the following in mind:

1. **Define the Objective Clearly**: Know what you want to achieve‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs information retrieval, creativity, or problem-solving.

2. **Be Specific and Detailed**: The more specific you are, the better. Include context, desired output format, tone, and length. For example, instead of saying ‚Äúwrite a poem about space,‚Äù say ‚Äúwrite a 500-word narrative poem about a lone astronaut exploring a new galaxy, in a classic sci-fi style.‚Äù

3. **Use Examples to Guide Output**: Provide an example format if you have a specific structure in mind. This helps the model understand what is expected.

4. **Put Instructions at the Start**: Place instructions at the beginning of the prompt and clearly separate them from the context.

5. **Iterate and Improve**: Evaluate the output and adjust your prompt as necessary. Iteration is key to finding effective wording.

6. **Think Like You‚Äôre Asking a Person**: Imagine you‚Äôre making a request to someone else‚Äîgive clear context and detailed instructions to improve the quality of the response.
