## 1. Basic Rules

**MUGEN GALAXY HORIZON is an adventure game that blends the features of a board game and a tabletop RPG (TRPG) into a highly flexible experience.**

Players will explore the vast universe, grow their characters, and take on numerous challenges together.

**The game features simple rules for beginners to enjoy easily, while also offering deep strategic elements for more experienced players.**

### Difficulty Levels

**In MUGEN GALAXY HORIZON, you can choose from three difficulty levels.**

- **Normal**: A standard difficulty that is balanced and recommended for beginners. Resources are plentiful, and enemies are not too strong.
- **Hard**: Resources are scarcer, and enemies are stronger. This level is for players who want a more challenging adventure.
- **Death Mode**: In addition to the challenges of Hard mode, the game ends when your character dies, and the character sheet is deleted. It is the most demanding difficulty for those who want the thrill of high stakes.

### How the Game Progresses

MUGEN GALAXY HORIZON is a turn-based game in which players take turns sequentially.

Each player rolls the dice 🎲 during their turn and decides on their actions.

Each turn consists of three phases: "Movement," "Action," and "End."

**Movement Phase**

Roll the dice to determine how many spaces to move.

As you move through the galaxy, you will encounter various events and challenges. 🌀

Where you land depends on luck, making each adventure different and exciting.

Along the way, there are locations with hidden treasures and places where enemies await.

**Action Phase**

In this phase, you deal with events, battle enemies ⚔️, or collect resources.

You have the freedom to choose what to do in this phase. The difficulty you choose affects the strength of enemies and the availability of resources, so plan your actions carefully.

You can gather resources to prepare for the next turn, fight enemies for rewards, or cooperate with companions in special events.

Roll the dice to determine whether your actions succeed. If you succeed, you receive rewards.

**Which action you take is entirely up to you, allowing you to strategize as you advance through the game.** 🧠

**End Phase**

Pass the turn to the next player.

During this phase, you can check your character’s status and inventory. 📦

It’s also a good idea to discuss with your companions to plan your next turn.

By focusing on teamwork, you can achieve even better results.

### Using the Dice

This game uses six-sided dice (D6) and ten-sided dice (D10).

When performing certain actions, the game master (GM) will decide on the difficulty of the action.

Players then roll the dice, and if they meet or exceed the target number, the action is successful. ✅

A successful action allows the character to gain experience points or items. 💎

Items can include weapons and armor that give an advantage in combat, or accessories that provide special skills.

Even if you fail, your companions might help you out of a tough situation. 🤝

### Character Creation

Before starting the game, you create your own character.

Characters have "races" and "roles (classes)," which include the following:

- **Starios Tribe** 🌌 (Traveler)

   A free-spirited group of travelers who are skilled in exploring unknown parts of the galaxy and enjoying adventures.

- **Altera Tribe** ⚔️ (Warrior)

   Masters of stellar energy, they serve as protectors of the galaxy with high offensive and defensive abilities.

- **Celestia Tribe** 💰 (Merchant)

   Masters of intergalactic trade, skilled negotiators who excel at gathering resources efficiently.

- **Astronix Tribe** 🔬 (Scientist)

   Experts in astrophysics, these scientists explore new frontiers, using their knowledge and skills to overcome challenges.

- **Anomalis Tribe** 🌀 (Outcasts)

   A group with revolutionary ideas that challenge the norms of the universe, acting outside conventional rules.

Each character has unique skills and equipment, allowing for a rich variety of playstyles.

Beginners can easily follow the guides to create their own character, so feel free to join in! 😊

When creating a character, you allocate skill points and select equipment, giving each character unique traits that differ from other players.

You are free to develop your skills, whether you want a character that excels in combat or one that is skilled in negotiation—there are many ways to enjoy playing. 🎮

## 2. Combat and Exploration

In MUGEN GALAXY HORIZON, players experience two major elements throughout their adventures: combat and exploration.

Combat allows players to grow their characters by defeating enemies, while exploration unravels the mysteries of the galaxy, bringing in valuable rewards and experiences.

Both elements rely heavily on players' choices and strategies, allowing for more enjoyment through teamwork.

### Combat System

Combat is turn-based, with players choosing actions like "Attack🗡️," "Defend🛡️," or "Use a Special Skill✨."

You roll the dice to determine the success of attacks or defenses.

Enemies also roll the dice, meaning luck and strategy play key roles. 🔑

Some enemies have special abilities, making teamwork essential for victory.

Winning battles earns players experience points and items, allowing characters to grow stronger. 🎉

As characters grow, they learn new skills and acquire more powerful equipment.

Conversely, losing a battle may result in reduced health or penalties, but you can always recover with the help of your companions. 🤝

Failure isn't the end—keep challenging yourself and don’t give up! 💪

### Exploration System

While exploring the galaxy, various events occur on each space.

On a "Resource Gathering Space," you collect items and resources 🔍, while "Event Spaces" present special happenings. 🎲

New experiences await each time, determined by the roll of the dice.

Explore the galaxy, grow your character, and uncover its mysteries! 🚀

At times, players may cooperate to solve mini-games like puzzles, which reward them with special items or experience points.

You may also interact with NPCs (non-player characters) to receive new quests.

Conversations with NPCs are key to progressing the story, and your choices can lead to different outcomes. 🌌

## 3. Game Ending Conditions and Rewards

MUGEN GALAXY HORIZON offers diverse goals and a sense of accomplishment for players.

At the end of the grand adventure, reaching the center of the galaxy leads to various rewards and story conclusions.

**Players can reach different endings based on their choices and strategies, offering a fulfilling sense of achievement through the game.**

### Game Ending Conditions

The objective is to complete side scenarios while aiming for the center of the galaxy and warping to new galaxies!

You may meet the creator, create a new galaxy, inherit the role of the creator, or even kill the creator to bring about an age of chaos—the choice is yours!

Achieving these goals will end the game, giving everyone a sense of accomplishment. 🏆

Each player can also set individual goals, which can conclude the game when fulfilled.

How you choose to explore is entirely up to you! ✨

At the center of the galaxy, special rewards and secrets await, and uncovering these can significantly advance the storyline.

### Rewards and Character Growth

As you progress through the game, you earn experience points that help your character grow.

Leveling up grants new skills and enhances your equipment. ⚔️

Growing your character allows you to take on bigger challenges. 💪

Leveling up also increases your health and attack power, improving your chances of success in exploration and combat.

You can also receive "special rewards" for completing specific missions, granting unique abilities to your character.

Strengthening your character enables you to face stronger enemies and tackle more challenging quests. 🌠
