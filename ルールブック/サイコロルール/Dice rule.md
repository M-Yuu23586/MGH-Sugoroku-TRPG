# The Joyful Adventure of Infinite Galaxy - MUGEN GALAXY HRIZON Friendly Dice Rules 🚀✨

These rules are simple and easy to use, but there are a few points that could make things even more exciting. Let’s dive into some of those improvements with a big bang! 😄🎲

## Suggestions and Improvements

### 1. **Balancing Dice Rolls** 🎲

- The current rules use fixed results for difficulty levels, but this may not always be ideal for every situation. To add a little more "Will it work?! Oh, I hope so!" feeling, it would be better to make the difficulty levels more flexible. For example, if "Easy" requires a 4 or higher, the success rate is around 2/3, which might be a bit too easy. Adjusting the success rate based on the situation will make players think more strategically. 🤔

### 2. **Adding More Impact from Skills and Traits** 💪✨

- Currently, character skills and traits are partially reflected through "extra dice," but if we make it clearer so players can say, "I’m strong, look at this!", it will greatly increase the sense of achievement.
  - **Suggestion**: For example, specific skills (like exploration, combat, negotiation) could give bonuses like "+1 for certain actions," making each character's personality shine even brighter. Let their uniqueness sparkle! 🌟

### 3. **Expanding Partial Success** 🌈

- Right now, "partial success" only happens if you beat the target by just one point. By expanding this range, you can create moments like, "Yes! But... uh-oh?" For instance, if you succeed within 2 points of the target, it could count as a partial success, leading to more varied outcomes.

### 4. **Adding Resource Management** 📦⚡️

- Instead of just rolling dice, managing resources like health, energy, and ammo can make exploration and combat more thrilling, like "Oh no, I’m out of ammo!" Right now, there are no elements of resource management, but adding it could be a fun challenge.
  - **Suggestion**: Actions should require resource consumption, such as using up ammo or energy in combat, or losing stamina during exploration. Who knew running out could be this much fun!? 💥

### 5. **Player vs. Player Conflict** 🤜🤛

- Adding a rule to handle player-vs-player conflicts smoothly will make the game more exciting with moments like, "I'm gonna win this one!"
  - **Suggestion**: When players clash, each rolls a die, and the player with the highest result wins and gets to act first. Imagine the victory face! 😏✨

### 6. **Random Events and Special Effects** 🎲💥

- To make combat and exploration less predictable, adding random events and special effects can add a thrilling sense of "What's gonna happen next?!" Just be careful with the frequency and impact, or it might get chaotic.
  - **Suggestion**: Create a rule where rolling a 1 or 6 triggers a special event. If it’s a 1, "Oh no, trouble's brewing!" and if it's a 6, "Woohoo, critical success!" This will make the game even more fun! 🎉

## Improved Simple Rules (Suggestions)

### Basic Dice Rules

#### 1. Types of Dice 🎲

- Use six-sided dice (d6), one or more. Every time you roll, think, "Here we go, let's do this!"

#### 2. Action Success Check 🎯

- Difficulty scale:
  - **Easy: 3 or higher**
  - **Medium: 4 or higher**
  - **Hard: 5 or higher**
  - **Very Hard: 6 only**
  Players roll a d6, and if they meet or exceed the set difficulty, they succeed. It's the moment of truth—exciting, isn’t it?

#### 3. Success, Partial Success, Failure 🏆❓💥

- **Full Success**: If the result is 2 points or more above the difficulty, you get a great result. "Yes, I nailed it!"
- **Partial Success**: If you exceed the difficulty by just 1 point, you succeed, but with a twist—something small comes at a cost. "Well, I did it, but..."
- **Failure**: If you don’t meet the difficulty, you fail, and things could get worse. "Oops, that didn’t work!"

#### 4. Combat Rules ⚔️

- Keep attacks and defenses simple:
  - Attack: Roll the dice and determine success based on the enemy's defense value. "Will it hit?! Or miss?!"
  - If the enemy's HP hits zero, they’re defeated, or they might retreat under certain conditions. "Oh look, the enemy is running away!"
  - Players can roll bonus dice depending on their weapons or skills. "This is it, let’s finish them off!"
